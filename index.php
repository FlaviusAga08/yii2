                <p>Lay beside me and tell me what they've done
                    And speak the words I wanna hear to make my demons run
                    The door is locked now but it's open if you're true
                    If you can understand the me then I can understand the you
                    Lay beside me, under wicked sky
                    Through black of day, dark of night, we share this, paralyzed
                    The door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
                    Black heart scarring darker still but there's no sun shining through
                    No there's no sun shining through, no there's no sun shining
                    What I've felt, what I've known
                    Turn the pages, turn the stone
                    Behind the door, should I open it for you?</p>
